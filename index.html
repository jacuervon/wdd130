      <p>
        My name is Juli√°n Andr√©s Cuervo Narv√°ez, and I don't have any nicknames.
        Currently, I'm pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Software development.
        Some of my hobbies include programming, reading about servers and web
        technologies, playing video games, and watching series. I am married to
        a wonderful Chilean woman, and we have a 1 year old son named Esteban.
        Regarding my career, I am a programming technician and have been working
        as a programmer for 5 years at a digital marketing company.

        I am pursuing my Bachelor of Science (BS) degree at BYU-Idaho and
        appreciate the flexibility it provides for me to work and spend time
        with my family. I'm taking a web design course because it's related to
        my work, and I'm looking for job opportunities in that field. I have
        been a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints for
        almost 23 years. One of my favorite quotes from a Church leader is from
        David O. McKay: "No other success can compensate for failure in the
        home."

        Chile, a land of contrasts and incomparable beauty, is home to the
        Valpara√≠so region, a treasure on the Pacific coast. With its colorful
        houses on the hills, the bohemian charm of its cobbled streets, and the
        vibrant energy of its port, Valpara√≠so captivates those lucky enough to
        explore its corners. In addition to its rich history and architecture

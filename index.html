      My name is Juli√°n Andr√©s Cuervo Narv√°ez, and I don't have any nicknames.
      Currently, I'm pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Software development. Some of
      my hobbies include programming, reading about servers and web
      technologies, playing video games, and watching series. I am married to a
      wonderful Chilean woman, and we have a 1 year old son named Esteban.
      Regarding my career, I am a programming technician and have been working
      as a programmer for 5 years at a digital marketing company.

      I am pursuing my Bachelor of Science (BS) degree at BYU-Idaho and
      appreciate the flexibility it provides for me to work and spend time with
      my family. I'm taking a web design course because it's related to my work,
      and I'm looking for job opportunities in that field. I have been a member
      of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints for almost 23 years.
      One of my favorite quotes from a Church leader is from David O. McKay: "No
      other success can compensate for failure in the home."
